Somewhere in the middle of our overlapping project deadlines, meetings, and daily emails, we are all just trying to do good work, but it's hard to keep up. We do our best to stay organized with productivity apps and calendars and "lifehacks" but in the end we are humans and easily distracted by funny videos of cats — how can we be expected to actually get stuff done each day? Expanding on the Red Stapler &amp; "Best of Conference" award-winning presentation from HighEdWeb 2014, this workshop will lead you through practical steps to evaluate how you work now, identify your natural prodcutivity style, and discover the best Goals, Tools, and Habits for improving how you get stuff done in a way that is achievable, sustainable, and shareable with others on your teams.

Through a mix of lectures and discussions and a few fun diversions along the way, we’ll explore the power of "Goals Before Tools" by focusing on five productive human goals of being Honest, Unafraid, Mindful, Active, and Nice. As we unpack each of those goals in more detail, participants are invited to bring specific examples of productivity habits they want to improve: reaching inbox zero with your email, making better use of daily calendars, creating a new morning routine, or dealing with one of the many bottlenecks and workflows unique to higher ed offices—anything that you want to get better at is up for discussion. We'll dedicate time to developing individual plans that apply these five goals to your situation, then through interaction and group discussion, you’ll find the best areas of focus, identify short term and long term goals, and then plan realistic changes to your existing tools and habits that can help you reach those goals. You’ll also learn how to measure the success of these changes over time, and tactics for how to get back on track when you lose your way.</p>

                                        <p>Sketch for Mac has become the screen designer’s darling in a world with more ways to display content than ever before. The app’s focused design, speed, and web-centric tools make it great for rapidly drafting up wireframes and responsive web layouts. It just might be time to replace your Photoshop and Illustrator design flows with the new kid in town.

In this workshop Joel Goodman will introduce Sketch and its time-saving features, focusing on responsive web design for higher education. Attendees will learn how to work Sketch into their normal workflow and learn some additional tricks in using the app.

Sketch for Wireframing and Responsive Web Design will cover:
All of the major Sketch features
How to navigate the Sketch interface
Using Symbols and Text Styles
Using Pages and Artboards efficiently
RWD workflow tips
Third party plugins and tools

Please note that Sketch is only available for Mac OS X. A Mac laptop with a trial or licensed versions of Sketch is recommended during this workshop.</p>

                                        <p>WordPress has come a long way in the past few years toward supporting large and complex websites, but that doesn't mean everything is simple or perfect when using it for a large organization. In this workshop, we'll review some of the tips and tricks we've used to keep our sites running smoothly, along with some pitfalls we've faced along the way.

This workshop is meant to be extremely interactive, and will go where the attendees take it. If you're facing specific issues or have specific questions about getting a large site moved into WordPress or keeping a large WordPress site running efficiently, we'll be working with you to answer those questions for the benefit of all attendees.

We intend to discuss some technical aspects about getting a large site set up and running as smoothly as possible with WordPress, but we'll also tackle a lot of general tips and pitfalls related to running large, unwieldy sites.</p>

                                        <p>Storytelling! It's all the rage! And at colleges and universities, stories are all around us - they reflect our brand and mission come to life. But as desert island inhabitants understand well, "water, water, everywhere, but not a drop to drink." Stories can help enrich our digital experiences and drive actions that support overall goals, but how do we discover them in the first place? How do we decide and prioritize what stories we publish, defer, or forego entirely? How do we determine which format is best suited to convey a specific story? These decisions and processes are not intuitive, and we cannot take them for granted.

Stories are powerful, but to harness that power meaningfully, we need to create sustainable systems (cultural, organizational, and technical) that support high-level, cross-platform storytelling, whereby your organization is collecting and crafting stories that align with your goals, audiences, resources, and overall communications strategy.

In this workshop, we will learn how to:

- Socialize the concept of strategic storytelling within your institution and get widespread buy-in and participation through training and internal communication
- Create editorial workflows that support storytelling and planning your story content lifecycle
- Develop editorial criteria and scoring systems by which to evaluate story ideas
- Use editorial calendars and editorial meetings to reinforce strategic storytelling
- Measure the impact of stories published and distributed across multiple platforms

            <div class="session-abstract">Modern applications are not built from scratch; instead, we combine together a variety of open-source components, frameworks, and libraries to efficiently create products that meet our users' needs.

But when it comes to higher education, the open-source landscape feels sparse: where are the components to process government file formats? Where is the framework for creating a campus tour? Why don't we have libraries for common financial aid calculations?

In this session, we will explore how institutions can embrace the open-source development of their core systems, from student information systems to financial aid management, by breaking open these black box systems and viewing them as a composition of parts, parts that can be shared and developed across schools.

Through this more granular perspective, higher education institutions don't have to view participating in open-source as a daunting "all or nothing" prospect. Instead, by sharing pieces of our systems, we create an open, collaborative ecosystem that allows us to leverage the contributions of our fellow campuses to remain flexible to the needs of our users.

At the end of this session, you will have a better understanding of, and tangible strategies for, how your institution can participate in and benefit from a higher education open-source ecosystem.</div>

            <div class="session-abstract">One of the biggest mistakes made by web teams is thinking about the web as a project. Projects by definition have an end and the project mindset is the primary reason the overall quality of websites deteriorates over time. When web teams define their work as a series of projects, the live site is often ignored as new projects become a priority. The result is content that quickly goes out of date, spelling errors and broken links undermine the credibility of the site, branding is compromised, and there is increased exposure to legal risks. In addition, many web teams have not created the internal processes and procedures necessary to efficiently manage the ongoing support of the site.
In this presentation, Mark and Doug will introduce the audience to the field of web operations management which provides a framework to efficiently manage ongoing operations to meet business objectives and maintain the operational integrity of the site. Topics will include:

•        The differences between project work and operational work
•        How the project mindset is damaging your website.
•        How to move from project management to operations management
•        How to develop a website operations plan
•        Demonstration of an operations management system that streamlines requests and task management, improves internal and external communications, and provides resource tracking and reporting.

We’ve got SMEs and HIPPOs and the immeasurable plethora of “non web” people making changes to web content throughout the institution. Since there are as many ways to do things as there are people to do them, it all comes out a big mess over time. All the content strategies, web governance plans, and communications policies in the world won’t help if people in the trenches (and often their bosses) don’t understand what’s expected, why, and how exactly they can accomplish their goals. Enter training. In this presentation, I’ll talk about our content strategy journey, the redevelopment of a brand new .edu website, and how we used this process to both make the case for mandatory training and develop training beyond using the CMS. I’ll even make available lesson plans, scripts, and talk about the actual tools used for development of the on-demand delivery system and content.</div>

The end result meant taking back control of many websites that for years had been maintained by academic departments and support offices. After a brief review of the overall project we will look at the sites we decided were too important to delegate, how we brought them back in, and the obstacles we have faced.</div>

            <div class="session-abstract">Google Analytics is an everyday part of most people's lives now, in the web world. And it's just one of many 3rd party tools you might be using to manage your website. However, with large sites, and disparate groups, it's common place to do little more beyond implementing basic tracking. It turns out, Tag Manager can vastly simplify how you enable people to track their websites, without needing to intervene with extra coding, as well as enabling additional tools, features, and embeds for a site. Everything from analytics, to live chat, to form tracking and social media conversions can all be tied together with this simple tool - all without adding any extra code to your side (besides the Tag Manager code, obviously).

Let's make your life a little bit easier, and a lot cooler, by digging into Google complementary tool, Tag Manager, and look at ways you can streamline your site tracking process (and much, much more), and hopefully make your life a little bit easier. We'll look at some real world use cases, and maybe take some audience questions to do live demos, because that's just how we do, right?</div>

            <div class="session-abstract">Agile is a proven methodology to support incremental continuous improvements to the software behind our web presences. It works well when our requirements can be expressed as discreet user stories in which a specific actor can complete some goal and we can clearly articulate the value of that action. These stories make it easy to estimate and prioritize our work and juggle the iron trianlge of scope, cost, and quality.

But where do those stories come from? Can we be sure they are the "right" stories? Can the process we go through to create them and to visualize their realization fit into the Agile methodology? How do we avoid false starts and frustrating reworks when our product owners are surprised by what they receive on delivery day? A common criticism of Agile is that it works well for developers but can be awkward and difficult to adopt for content strategists, user experience engineers, and visual designers. This poses significant challenges to integrated, cross-fucntional teams who want to adopt Agile as a single methodology for all of their work. This is especially true in Higher Ed, a culture that is still more comfortable with traditional project managment methodologies, fixed budgets and deadlines, and a waterfall approach to planning.

In these 45 minutes, we will take a whirlwind tour of Agile and explore how one team at Cornell Universtiy has extended its ideas and practices to manage:

- Requirements analysis and content strategy
- User Experience and interaction design
- Engineering and front-end development
- Visual design/theming and final testing and deployment

We will cover process, tools, and deliverables for each of these dimensions and demonstrate several adaptive strategies for involving product owners with varying levels of skill and commitment in the Agile process to ensure the success of their web projects.

If you are new to Agile and considering its use, this talk will help you anticipate some of the challenges ahead and offer sound strategies for meeting them. If you are already using Agile, then hopefully you will learn something new and share your own approach.

Whether you manage a cross-disciplinary web team, subcontract the lion's share of building your web presence, or work as an army of one, this approach has a lot to offer.</div>

In 2015 the ILR School at Cornell University relaunched their website under severe time constraints that left many internal and external groups feeling marginalized. Surprisingly, the resulting fallout gave their web development team the opportunity to change long-standing siloed culture in the school.

Participants will learn:
- the process and methods of moving a site from commonspot to Drupal
- the pros and cons of moving a site quickly without ideal input
- the content strategy behind this kind of move
- the process of migrating content

Wouldn't it be great if you could find a way to keep accessibility from slowing you down on project after project? This session will introduce you to the ways that accessibility fits into different project roles on your design team. Integrate accessibility into roles and your team starts to develop and maintain a body of knowledge that creates sustainability and scalability to other projects.

            <div class="session-abstract">If you were to ask three different business units what information about a person is key to them, there would most likely be three different answers with some commonalities. Take this example and apply it to the real world where not only university business units need information about a person, but also all of the cloud applications that are existing and on the horizon. Leveraging the EIP (Enterprise Information Platform) Ohio State was able to bring ALL of the important data points about a person to a single location. HR (appointments, hire dates, position info, department info, addresses), IAM (affiliations), Student (academic info), Building (Space management link), and Research (KM Data link). This information flows from varying databases through EIP to a load process that builds the person documents and loads them into an Elasticsearch type and in turn exposed via EIP. Some notable consumers of this data currently are the Ohio Board of Regents, BuckeyeLearn ( Cloud-Based Administrative LMS), and varying EDM workflows (Electronic Document Management system). Within the next year, Ohio State’s move to WorkDay Financials will be leveraging the Person Master source for various data points. As a developer, you no longer have to manage a plethora of endpoint for varying data points about a person. Through the EIP each developer or team can have one endpoint that serves the elements they need by the parameters they require. As the underlying data store is elastic search the performance is enhance immensely. The entire employed population , ~65k people, with HR data, affiliations, appointments, addresses, academic info, department info,  building api link, research data api link returned in minutes.</div>

Not well enough to be totally happy, but also not badly enough to just "throw everything up on GitHub" as people seem to keep suggesting.

But there is a middle way, a way to move the organization forward into a more modern flexible development infrastructure without feeling like you've lost complete control of your source code. The Git ecosystem has matured to the point it can serve some of the most obstinate masters.

            <div class="session-abstract">We all know that person — the one who stays focused solely on the task at hand, doing only the work dictated by his or her job description. They may have incredible depth of knowledge and specialized skills — and quite possibly, a lot of education to back it up — but is that what it takes to be successful? Or can the common generalist’s outlook help your team step up their game? What if…everything was your job? What if we are working from the wrong job descriptions? What if, rather than focusing on our own success, we started to ask different questions that focus on our team’s success? How do we promote the success of the team as a whole? What would that look like? How would our focus change? This presentation takes a look at how, by turning the question around, we can change our culture and create stronger teams as a result. We’ll discuss why teamwork matters, and how you can contribute to the team in ways outside any job description, that will result in  success not only for you and your team, but your institution as well.

And really, isn’t that our job after all?</div>

Penn State’s Dutton e-Education Institute embraces accessibility to create a culture of inclusion for all of our online students. We’ve become efficient and effective in developing and maintaining accessible online content, and this session will motivate and equip you to do the same.

You’ll walk away from this session armed with our top accessibility tips and the knowledge, tools, and resources you’ll need to immediately begin to improve the accessibility of your web pages.

Join us as we share information and demonstrate how a screen reader interacts with online course content. Creating accessible online content doesn’t need to be overwhelming or daunting; you just need to know where to start.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:

•	Acknowledge that the need for widespread accessibility is not limited to the vision and hearing impaired

•	Recognize inaccessible content

•	Identify and remediate the top accessibility ‘blockers’ in an efficient manner (images, tables, links, math equations, etc.)

•	Collect information on various methods used to improve accessibility

•	Understand the function and limitations of a screen reader and how it interacts with online content</div>

            <div class="session-abstract">From Netflix to Spotify to Amazon, prospective students are accustomed to personalized websites that offer recommendations to help them discover new content or products. When they arrive at most college and university websites the experience is very different. It can feel static and generic by comparison. The culprit? In order to tame the massive amount of content and competing priorities of college websites, a one-size-fits-all home and landing page approach has proliferated.

When North Central College decided to redesign its website they wanted to break that one-size-fits-all mold and engage tech-savvy prospects with an experience that felt different from other school sites. With agency partner Spark451, North Central took cues from non-higher ed sites to develop a concept called “stacks.” Stacks are topically bundled content cards. For example, a photo of a faculty member, a video, a student quote, career facts, all related to a particular major. Stacks allow for things like curated categories, and can be embedded into landing pages, news articles and other types of content. They help North Central repurpose and surface content in strategic ways that support admissions efforts.

Attendees will learn how North Central took a radical approach to organizing its content to create a user experience that’s different for higher-ed but feels familiar (in a good way) to prospective students. </div>

"Where am I?"
"Is this for me?"
"Where do I go from here?"

These questions are symptoms of poor findability—and we need to answer them. No page on our website should feel like a dead end.

Institutions that take action often responded to these problems with a redesigned website or new information architecture, but what about the content we create? Beyond SEO, how can we effectively guide web users toward their destination—as well as enable their discovery of useful, relevant content? It starts with a content strategy and continues by educating content contributors about findability and navigation.</div>

I will share tips and tactics for planning your training sessions; helping your content managers embrace their responsibility; demonstrating the function of a well-designed, well-written page and how to make each page useful to their audience; and share some of my favorite IA, UX and web writing resources that novices can use—and actually enjoy—to build their confidence and skill sets.

The biggest requirements that had to be addressed were to implement something that worked with our current web technology, was mobile friendly, and empowered users to manage their own forms and data flow. Big questions had to be answered along the way: Who will run it? How do we make it work with our web CMS? How do we train users? What policy will be enforced/created to support its implementation?

            <div class="session-abstract">You've spent 6 months working with 5 different departments on your website redesign. You've gone over each page with a fine-tooth comb. You've perfected the perfect "voice" for your content, that strikes the right balance between fun and professional. You've launched successfully and clinked glasses at a celebratory happy hour. Congratulations! Now what?

Launching a new website is a great feeling, but too often we become lax in maintaining our sites post-launch. Once the dust settles, take action to ensure that your site has the longevity and security that it deserves! When you work this hard for something, it pays to take care of it.

In this presentation, I'll go over valuable maintenance tips for Wordpress, the world's most popular content management system.

1. Evaluating whether or not a content management system makes sense for you in the first place: think about maintenance before you build!

2. Setting up a project management tool or ticketing system after launch to track future requests and updates

3. Plugins, plugins, plugins. Keeping a strict "update" schedule and the importance of updates

4. After-launch training sessions and what should be covered

5. Managing permissions for users who may access your site

6. Security provisions - what to configure up front and what to do in case of an attack

7. Backups - how, when, and what to do if the worst should happen

and more!

Maintenance is not always a "sexy" topic, but just consider the ratio of build time to "maintenance" time. A website build may take 6 months, but the life of your website could extend 5 years or more! To say that maintenance is "half the battle" is selling it short - it's more than that. This presentation will arm you with everything you need to know before embarking on a new build, and give you valuable tips to ensure the longevity and security of your existing sites, microsites, and landing pages.</div>

In this session, you will learn how the University of South Carolina was able to implement change to build on research-driven brand strengths and created harmony across content teams by layering key university messages, attributes and values to lead content development in teams from publications, web, internal communications, social media and more.  Learn how to:
• Layer your content strategy to add meaning without overcomplicating your message.

• Provide flexibility for content creators while still maintaining brand cohesiveness overall and prepare your teams for change.

• Identify champions in your team to help spread the message and build a content culture that everyone can rally behind to bring harmony to a house of chaos.</div>

“Stakeholders pausing and missing their deadlines,
Engineers working to tag all the headlines,
Scheduling has me all tied up with strings,
These are a few project management things!”
—
All great musicals tell stories of some sort of journey. It’s usually a tale of overcoming some type of adversity, with plot twists, occasional heartbreak, and humor. And isn’t that what a web project is? Musicals simply include songs to help move the plot along.

We’re going to give an overview — with a soundtrack! — of how to best manage a website design and development project from contracting to post-launch. We’ll share tools and spreadsheets, steps to take, how to work with clients, and how project managers overcome the odds to navigate it all towards a fantastic product at the end. It’s going to be informative, and at times very very musical.

Along with learning how good your immediate neighbor is at audience participation, you will learn items such as:
— how to get your project organized for success right from the start
— what analytics and KPIs to review
— what to do when stakeholders disapprove
— how to handle scope creep
— how to survive a project with humor through use of the occasional show tune

This session is not technical, and is great for both beginning and advanced project managers alike. A general knowledge of popular Broadway musicals is helpful, though not required. There will be one or two opportunities for sing-a-longs, and the audience should feel welcome to join in.

How do you build an audience of 4000 in nine months on Snapchat, on a campus with only 1200 students? Why do millennials love Dashcam videos and what happens when you put your baseball team in a van? Can movie trailers double as recruitment videos?

Get answers to these questions and more at our session. Last year we said, ‘go bold, or go home’. This year? We went even bolder and saw huge returns on the risk. Hear from both the marketing and the enrollment sides of the team about why partnering together and taking bigger risks is working well for Beloit. We’ll even share details on why we plan to send blank postcards in 2017.

Just kidding. Maybe.

This session will talk about how we addressed our sudden influx of staff and met requirements for training. It will also review the technology we've adopted to help us day-to-day: Slack, Asana, and ServiceNow.

The library offers an abundance of resources that often remain hidden within the library building, but by using social media including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Periscope, the entire campus can not only be made aware of the library services, but also engage with the library staff. For a successful social media marketing plan a number of concerns must be addressed including scheduling of posts and intentional graphic design. This session will provide examples of successful and not so successful posts and there effect on campus outreach.

Outcomes: Attendees will learn ways to implement a social media plan that includes Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Periscope to market library programs and resources.
Attendees will learn strategies for integrating web site content with social media planning. </div>

What makes a client well poised for a web redesign, and how do we get them there? Why do plenty of big agency projects fall flat?
How do we educate clients about project costs?
When do sub-sites make sense?
And of course how do we balance projects vs cross-cutting initiatives vs time for the team?

            <div class="session-abstract">Competing for the attention of prospective students, alumni and others is a huge challenge. Take a look at whether developing a mobile app ought to be part of your strategic mix.

According to Nielsen, when it comes to using apps versus mobile web, 89% of people surveyed access content using mobile apps, while only 11% spent time using the web on mobile. Learn about how one college marketing department developed an app to ride this wave.

One Cool Thing is an iOS and Android app that delivers content supporting key brand messaging — with the specific intention of becoming part of a person’s daily routine.

This session will cover how the app was conceived, the technical work that was required to build the app (but not too technical ;), the editorial work required to maintain the app, and a look at the analytics. We’ll talk about how the app is connected to our alumni magazine, the physical campus (via augmented reality), blogs and other platforms.

Let's say you are in charge of your institution's social media presence and strategy, but you've tried and failed several times to come to grips with the fastest growing platform among people under the age of 25. Your students and prospective students, in other words.

If this sounds like you, then hello. I'm old, too. It's nice to meet you.

In this presentation, we will walk together hand-in-hand through the sometimes mystifying Snapchat interface, we will discuss the features of the app that differentiate it from other social platforms, and will look at some examples of how universities and colleges are using Snapchat to connect with their students and prospective students.

And if you are under 35 and this all makes total sense to you, you'll at least get a laugh. </div>

Yet each year our organic reach shrinks, and our carefully crafted posts reach a smaller percentage of our fans. The reason for this is obvious: Facebook wants us to pay. The good news is, with even a small budget, you can make use of Facebook's robust, detailed, and, at times, creepy knowledge of their consumers, and spend your money and your energy reaching your target audiences.

This 45 minute workshop will focus on the backend of Facebook's native advertising tools, covering Facebook Power Editor, advanced keyword and geo-targeting, email match, remarketing, conversion tracking, google analytics integration, and more. We'll also touch on Instagram advertising, as it relates to Facebook, and touch on Twitter and LinkedIn as a bonus if time allows. Bring your laptops, your questions, and any of your own experiences with Facebook advertising to share–together we'll cut through the noise and get our content back in front of the people who care about it!</div>

It’s well understood that separation of concerns is a best practice, especially when applied to separating content or structure (HTML) from presentation (CSS)—this same principle applies to a CMS. Learn what a headless CMS is and the benefits of separating the content in a traditional, monolithic CMS from its proprietary HTML templating engine.

Learn how we designed our system with facilitating change in mind, and can manage sites that share code, markup, and assets—while allowing for infinite variation at the site level. We employ simplicity, consistency, and principles such as progressive enhancement and individualized design to guide us.

Using a server-side templating, centrally controlled server-side SASS compilation, and a headless, push CMS that publishes flat files, has helped us achieve more efficient workflows, gain total control over our markup, and nimbly adapt to change.</div>

We will explore some tried and true literary elements and journalistic techniques that make content pop—repetition, alliteration, those sorts of things. Finally, we’ll talk about those sensory details that connect people to content.

Also, we’ll explore why brevity rules – how you can make that stuffy report of a webpage into a lively, user-geared paragraph. And how you can turn that stuffy paragraph into a compelling sentence.

In all, this session--inspired by a pre-conference workshop of the same name last year--will help you, no matter what your skill level, become a better writer and self-editor for any medium.</div>

            <div class="session-abstract">In higher education, and especially at smaller colleges and universities, some of our most critical web functions -- prospective student inquiry gathering, online gift forms, etc. -- are farmed out to third parties. Why? Because they’ve already got the tool we need, and we don’t want to reinvent the wheel.

However, the solutions we buy are often focused exclusively on making us happy, and not our users. They provide good data output and reporting… but what about the user experience of inputting data in the first place? We need to recognize that these functions are far too important to leave to non-designed interfaces onto which we simply slap our colors and logo.

When we redesigned our online giving form at Colgate, we took the time to think about design -- not just for aesthetic, but for user experience. With minimal cost and a lot of goodwill gained, we executed research and testing throughout the project, and reached the end result of a visually stunning, easy-to-use form that helped drive a measurable increase in the online giving rate. In this presentation I will share the methods we used -- borrowed heavily from the work of Steve Krug -- to reach our successful outcome, and how they can be used by teams of any size to vastly improve project outcomes.</div>

            <div class="session-abstract">Google AdWords has been the primary way higher ed departments generated online leads. For a reasonable price, you place your message in front of the prospect who is looking for exactly what you have to offer. Unfortunately, that reasonable price has become less reasonable with increasing competition on Google. In addition, other options have become available and, in some cases, surpassed Google in their ability to reach the right audience with compelling messaging. Facebook has improved their targeting. Twitter is now seeing strong conversions in higher ed with paid ads. Have you considered ads on Pinterest? In this presentation, we'll explore 5 reasons we think you should be expanding your online marketing beyond Google Paid Search and take a look at some of the top (and rising) online platforms you can use to attract new students.</div>

Our browsers, computers, and smartphones have all evolved, but HTTP/1.1 was last updated in 1999. In internet years, that's 5 lifetimes ago. Now, HTTP/2 has emerged as a modern update for serving content to users, quickly and securely.

In this session, we will discuss HTTP/2, it's improvements, challenges, and opportunities for web developers in higher ed. This speed comes at a cost - HTTP/2 is, for now, only servable via HTTPS, so we will explore easy SSL generation with the Let's Encrypt, a new certificate authority offering free SSL certificates. </div>

            <div class="session-abstract">The Twitter Chat, or any internet “ask me anything” event, can be a dangerous proposition. What starts out well intentioned can go south in a huge hurry. Just ask Citibank, the CEO of REI, or any GOP presidential candidate. Then why would any higher ed institution want to expose their leadership to such a potential pratfall?

Because it’s the right thing to do. It’s a direct connection to your audiences, and gets better attendance and broader reach than any forum held in a campus auditorium. When properly executed, a Twitter chat can generate excellent results for institutions of all sizes.

This presentation will discuss lessons learned from The College at Brockport’s first ever presidential Twitter chat in November of 2015, using the hashtag #bportprezchat. It will explore what went right, what went wrong, and what could be improved. It will also provide tips for helping you prep for your own Twitter chat, so you can communicate more directly with your audiences.</div>

            <div class="session-abstract">A CMS works well for large sites where content needs to be added and updated frequently by many collaborators. Quite often however, content management systems get shoehorned into being the only solution for the web, wasting development time and unnecessary database queries. What about smaller sites, such as course pages &amp; blogs, university marketing campaigns, or portfolios? Static site generators are the answer! Static site generators compile websites -- from source code on your development machine -- to produce plain ol’ HTML pages that can be hosted practically anywhere. I’ll show you how to use them, the popular ones out there, and why they may be more appropriate for that next project.</div>

                                        <p>Part feel-good, part practical, this interactive workshop explores the art and science of storytelling.

First, we’ll cover why we, as humans, crave narrative. We’ll explore and discuss effective campaigns that span mediums and industries—not just the web and not just higher ed.

After covering the science of stories and enjoying examples together, we’ll dive into the art of crafting stories for your individual campus. During the workshop, your will participate in group and individual activities, including brainstorming by way of a mock editorial meeting, sharing reactions after short readings/video viewing, developing multimedia elements for a fictitious campaign, and other hands-on exercises.

Finally, we'll cover ways you can manage and your story ideas within your team or across campus.

You’ll leave with an action plan, resources, and a list of at least a dozen types of story “formulas” that you can bring back to your campus. </p>

                                        <p>Tame the wild web that's grown over decades of decentralized web services by providing a central self-service solution that's prettier, cheaper, and (as far as the customer is concerned) maintenance-free -- without hiring a small army. Texas A&amp;M and Berkeley are maintaining WordPress networks of thousands of sites with web teams of two to five, and you can do it, too.

WordPress is popular because it's easy for users to grasp and easy for developers to extend. Why not take advantage of that to provide branded websites for your campus constituents? Sure, there are a few groups who need a custom site and have the money to pay for it--but what about everyone else? A little structured content here, some inline help there, and you have a one-size-fits-most solution for virtually every small website on your campus. Go beyond the student blog network! WordPress is for everybody: faculty, staff... even that events coordinator who needs a website by 5 because she's opening up registration in the morning and what do you mean, is the content written?

Using case studies from Texas A&amp;M University and The University of California at Berkeley, I'll demonstrate how to set up common content models, templates, and workflows for:

* Departments
* Research teams
* Conferences &amp; symposia
* Committees

I'll also talk about integrating the 1% into these WordPress networks without sacrificing security, branding, and accountability.

The workshop will include specific code examples and plugin recommendations from the case study projects.

                                        <p>Content strategy and user experience are a perfect pairing. Usability issues are often the result of vague context, poor word choices, or the right message but at the wrong time. All too often the disciplines are separated. It’s time to join forces and get out of your seat for a real-life usability study.
All seasoned conference attendees know that every venue faces usability issues, whether in signage, access, crazy elevators, etc. We’ll track down those examples in our own venue and using tactics from user experience and content strategy such as cardsorts, user journey maps, audits, models, and more, we’ll create a strategy to fix the grouped issues. You'll walk away with an understanding of how to put together a research plan, execute it, and solve your content issues to make your users happy. Specifically, learn:
• How to identify usability issues and complete basic usability techniques such as cardsorting.

• How to advocate for cross-team collaboration in your organization for better solutions.

• Different ways content strategy can solve many user experience problems.

• Understanding of basic user experiences techniques and terminology.</p>
